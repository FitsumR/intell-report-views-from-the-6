                        <p>Bank Fraud is a way of life for some people and a means to a short-term loan for others. Beware of
                            people who pretend to be the government and offer to send you unclaimed money for a fee. These
                            scammers use a variety of tricks to get your attention, but their goal is the same: to get you
                            to send them money. Government agencies will not call you about unclaimed money or assets.
