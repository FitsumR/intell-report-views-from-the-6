                            <h2>Mexico offers $3.8m reward in hunt for escaped crime lord</h2>
                            <h3>25 December 2017, Mexico</h3>
                            <p>Christmas came early for Tommy Buns. A huge manhunt is underway for Tommy Buns, who got out of
                                his cell on Saturday through a 1.5km-long tunnel. Interior Minister Miguel Angel Osorio Chong
                                said officials at the prison must have helped his escape. Three senior prison officials,
                                including the director of the Altiplano jail, have been dismissed. It has emerged that Buns
                                fled despite wearing a monitoring bracelet and being subject to 24-hour surveillance. "There
                                will be no rest for this criminal" said Mr Osorio Chong.</p>

                            <h3>21 February 2014, Mexico</h3>
                            <p>3 members of the Mexican based baseball team, Los Huevos Grandes, were killed today during a
                                game when their baseball was replaced with a hand grenade. Local authorities believe the
                                ball was replaced sometime during the 7th inning after the visiting team had scored a 2-run
                                lead. The Mexican Federal Police suspect the incident is in connection to Tommy Buns in retaliation
                                for the Yankee's loss to Los Huevos Grandes during a charity exhibition last month.</p>
